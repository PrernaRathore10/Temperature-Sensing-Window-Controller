This arduino based Temperature sensing automatic window controller project controls window open angle according to the room temperature and humidity. 
Show these parameter changes on the serial monitor.

-> Libraries used in this project are servo.h and dht.h .</br>
-> DHT sensor is used to sense the temperature and humitdity in the environment.</br>
-> It may also be used for monitoring changes in environment. </br>
-> In near future, it can also be used in different industries and electronic devices. </br>
-> Nowadays Arduino becomes more popular because of its many advantages like simple programming and compact in size and it supports many device.
